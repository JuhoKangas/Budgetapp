Learning git while studying through my Javascript course. Also using github to help me working with two different computers.

This is from the course "The Complete JavaScript Course 2020: Build Real Projects!" by Jonas Schmedtmann and this was done on boilerplate HTML/CSS. All javascript is written by myself following the lectures.
